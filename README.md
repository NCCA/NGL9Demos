# NGL9 Demos

This is a meta repository to allow the download of all the current NGL 9 demos in one go. It uses the git submodules to clone the other repositories and may take some time to download all the different demos as some are quite large. The total download is at present 1.9Gb

```
git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules git@github.com:/NCCA/NGL9Demos
```
